This is designed to be a listing of all the Cortana scripts I've written.  I anticipate on this to slowly grow as I learn more on Cortana scripting.  Hope it helps!

There will probably be many "basic" scripts that automate small operations, so I (or others) can automate certain tasks which can be individually selected based off my/an assessor's goals.  I will also add other scripts that perform many tasks within the same script as I see the attack chain.
